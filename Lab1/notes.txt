1. How do I get a reference to the current thread? 
	1. Look into thread.c and .h for more information if needed
	2. basically - *initial_thread is the main thread first then *idle_thread is the "idle" one 
	3. There is a thread class if needed to create more threads as I go along
	4. there is a thread that is the current one called *thread_current -> i guess you would just say &thread_current
2. How do I put a thread to sleep? 
        1. with timer_sleep is how I put them to sleep, but how in the world do I do the other stuff? 
3. How do I wake a thread up agin? 
        1. it should be in interrupt that I wake the thread up again
4. When do I check if anything needs waking up? ie what function gets called when the timer interrupt fires? 
        1. there should be a list I should check about it
5. How do I turn interrupts on and off? 
        1. interrupts are turned by interrupt on and off functions 
6. What is the C type of a thread? 


void 
timer_sleep(int64_t ticks){
    int64_t start = timer_ticks();
    ASSERT(intra_get_level() == INTR_ON)
    while(timer_elapsed(start) < ticks) { 
        thread_yield();
    }
}


alarm-efficient has to do with idle_threads
